<br>
this is a project combining web development and data analysis. 
<br>
The model I have used to make each of the data analysis projects is the k neighbors classifiers model.
<br><br>On clicking each of the project links, a Jupyter Notebook(on localhost) will open up which contains the working model along with the code.
